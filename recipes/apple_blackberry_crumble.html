    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Make this seasonal apple and blackberry crumble for a comforting family pud. Pre-cooking the topping will make it extra-crispy, while also retaining the texture of the fruit</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>120g plain flour</li>
        <li>60g caster sugar</li>
        <li>60g unsalted butter at room temperature, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>300g Braeburn apple</li>
        <li>30g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>30g demerara sugar</li>
        <li>115g blackberries</li>
        <li>¼ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>vanilla ice cream, to serve</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Tip 120g plain flour and 60g caster sugar into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 60g unsalted butter, then rub into the flour using your fingertips to make a light breadcrumb texture. Do not overwork it or the crumble will become heavy.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the mixture evenly over a baking sheet and bake for 15 mins or until lightly coloured.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for the compote, peel, core and cut 300g Braeburn apples into 2cm dice.</li>
        <li>Put 30g unsalted butter and 30g demerara sugar in a medium saucepan and melt together over a medium heat. Cook for 3 mins until the mixture turns to a light caramel.</li>
        <li>Stir in the apples and cook for 3 mins. Add 115g blackberries and ¼ tsp ground cinnamon, and cook for 3 mins more.</li>
        <li>Cover, remove from the heat, then leave for 2-3 mins to continue cooking in the warmth of the pan.</li>
        <li>To serve, spoon the warm fruit into an ovenproof gratin dish, top with the crumble mix, then reheat in the oven for 5-10 mins. Serve with vanilla ice cream.</li>
      </ol>
