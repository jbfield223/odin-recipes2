    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Enjoy halloumi in this family-friendly curry - it has a wonderful texture, similar to paneer. You may want to halve the amount of garam masala for young children.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>225g block halloumi</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flavourless oil (such as vegetable or sunflower oil)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>thumb-sized piece of ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>100ml double cream</li>
        <li>80g fresh or frozen baby spinach</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp nigella seeds</li>
        <li>cooked rice, grains or naan, to serve</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the halloumi into bite-sized cubes and set them aside. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for about 5 mins, or until it turns translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ginger to the pan. Cook for another 2 mins, stirring frequently, until they become fragrant. Stir in the cumin, coriander and turmeric, and cook for 2 mins more. Pour in the tomatoes and stir well. Simmer for 5-7 mins, or until the mixture thickens.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and add the cream. Stir and simmer gently for 3-4 mins until thickened.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil in a separate pan over a medium-high heat. Fry the halloumi for 3-4 mins until golden brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Once the halloumi is browned, add it to the sauce along with the spinach, sugar and garam masala and stir to combine. Gently simmer for 5 mins until the spinach has wilted or defrosted. If the curry seems too thick, add a splash of water or more cream to loosen it. Scatter with nigella seeds and serve with rice, grains or naan.</li>
      </ol>
