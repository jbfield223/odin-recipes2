    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Have a glut of tomatoes? Put them to good use in this one-pan orzo dish, perfect for a family midweek dinner. Finish with fresh parsley and plenty of parmesan</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 chilli, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
        <li>600g tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>400g orzo</li>
        <li>800ml vegetable stock</li>
        <li>handful of parsley, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>grated parmesan or vegetarian alternative, to serve (optional)</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan or frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 4-6 mins until softened but not golden. Add the garlic and chilli, and cook for 1 min more to soften. Stir in the tomatoes and cook for 5 mins until starting to break down.</li>
        <li>Stir in the orzo, then pour in the stock. Cook for 8-10 mins until the liquid has reduced and the orzo is tender â€“ add a few tablespoons of water if it begins to dry out. Scatter in three-quarters of the parsley and stir this through before serving in bowls topped with the remaining parsley and a grating of parmesan, if you like.</li>
      </ol>
